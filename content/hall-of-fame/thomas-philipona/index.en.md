Goodbye Thömu! Our founding father is embarking on a new journey and leaves APPUiO as an active team member. With joy and sadness, we look back on a wonderful time. Thömu, you will be remembered forever. For your future, we wish you only the best. As a small tribute, we have created the APPUiO Hall of Fame, in which you will be remembered as the first honorary member.
