The response time starts the moment we are informed about the support case and relates to the period until support will be provided. The response time defines the time frame between reception of the support case and start of analysis work on the problem. Example: The customer informs us about problem at 16:00. With SLA model "A", work on that support case will start at the latest at 17:00 the next day.
