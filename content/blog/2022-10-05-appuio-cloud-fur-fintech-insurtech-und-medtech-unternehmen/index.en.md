summary: 'What keeps Fintech, Insurtech & Medtech technical teams awake at
  night? Well, the easy answer would be "a lot of things," but a few always
  stand out in the list: security, regulatory frameworks, and infrastructure
  complexity. In our age of digitalization and increasingly competitive markets,
  engineers and CTOs face security breaches and complex legislation making new
  products more complicated and challenging to bring to market.'
