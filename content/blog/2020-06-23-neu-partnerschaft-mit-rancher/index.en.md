The growing requirements and specific use cases of our customers can now be covered with different distributions. With APPUiO we are now in the position to include additional use cases and always offer our customers the optimal solution.

**Rancher partnerships**

Both companies behind APPUiO are rancher partners. Already for one year [VSHN AG](https://vshn.ch/) maintains the partnership with Rancher. [Puzzle ITC GmbH](https://www.puzzle.ch/de/home) has recently become a proud Platinum Partner. In order to use these synergies in the best possible way, we have decided to complete the common Open Container platform APPUiO with Rancher.

Together with some customers we could already evaluate the suitable container platform in a study. This resulted in follow-up projects in which we have built a Kubernetes platform based on Rancher. One project, for example, we were able to carry out with the [Liechtenstein National Administration (LLV)](https://www.puzzle.ch/referenzen/rancher-container-plattform-fuer-liechtenstein).

**Rancher**

[Rancher Labs](https://rancher.com/) is a California-based open source software company that helps manage Kubernetes. With Rancher it is possible to run Kubernetes on any infrastructure. Rancher has a Kubernetes distribution and a web-based multi-cluster management tool for operation. With the multi-cluster management tool you can administer your own and other Kubernetes distributions as well as managed Kubernetes offers such as those from Amazon, Google or Microsoft. Rancher provides companies with a fast and uncomplicated way into the world of container orchestration and offers a lot of flexibility when designing a container platform. Rancher's distribution is based on Vanilla Kubernetes and integrates further tools from the [CNCF landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/) such as monitoring, logging, service mesh etc.

The addition of a further distribution enables APPUiO to offer a diversified range of container solutions. Through a careful evaluation, we will help you decide which Kubernetes distribution is right for you and your business. [Contact](mailto:hello@appuio.ch) us and we will meet for a coffee.
