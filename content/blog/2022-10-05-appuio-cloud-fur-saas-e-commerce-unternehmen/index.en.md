summary: Remember when 25 years ago people wondered what this "Internet" thing
  was? Times have changed to such an extent that these days even the smallest of
  businesses must have a SaaS & E-Commerce presence. But can they manage the
  complexity of a cloud platform? Can they afford runaway costs if they forget
  to turn a virtual machine off? The French like to say, "No one is safe from
  success." What would happen if your website became the preferred new shop of
  an Instagram influencer? Your next overnight success doesn't have to be your
  last.
