summary: >-
  Web and design agencies are always juggling a delicate balance between burnout
  and profitability. They have anxious customers on one side, and complex
  projects on the other. Dealing with the day-to-day intricacies of technology
  is a part of their core competency and value proposition, but at which level
  of the abstraction ladder do they draw the line? Shouldn't they just be
  creating value for your customers? Do they really want to deal with
  infrastructure and monitoring issues?


  As an agency developer, how do you spin an MVP for a prospective customer without breaking your bank account? How can you set a new environment to conduct A/B testing for new products? How can you keep an eye on cloud costs, while at the same time being agile and letting your teams spin new applications up as they need them?
