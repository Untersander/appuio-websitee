summary: "Independent software vendors have lots to worry about: managing the
  relationship with their chosen platform vendor; transforming awareness into
  cash flows through a marketing funnel; and that's without mentioning the daily
  intricacies and whims of software and code. Bugs! Features! Exceptions! Stack
  traces! But the biggest worry of them all is, however, cost management. How to
  make sure your cloud investment won't leave you bankrupt?"
