summary: On September 7th, we invited our community to the 8th edition of the
  Beerup at the VSHN Tower â€“ a casual gathering of techies who discussed not
  only beer but also the latest trends and developments in the container world.
  The late afternoon was marked by two fascinating presentations that offered
  profound insights into the current and upcoming developments of OpenShift,
  APPUiO Managed, and APPUiO Cloud.

### OpenShift and Beyond: A Glimpse into the Future

The session started with [Peter Mumenthaler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-mumenthaler-97b40965/?originalSubdomain=ch=89978449), Solution Architect at Red Hat. In his presentation "OpenShift and Beyond," he provided an overview of the recent developments in the OpenShift domain. Over the years, [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/de/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) has established itself as one of the leading application platforms based on Kubernetes. It impresses not just with its user-friendliness but also with its compelling functionalities.

Peter highlighted the exciting features and optimizations currently in progress and what the OpenShift community can expect in the near future. The roadmap for OpenShift seems promising, and we certainly look forward to some innovations.
