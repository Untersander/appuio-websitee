Lack of flexibility, technical challenges and extensive coordination: ‘In 2016, we realised that the configuration of various applications in the landscape was extremely complex,’ explains Matthias Summer, Senior System Engineer at Adcubum. Following intensive research into solutions, Adcubum decided to switch to Red Hat’s OpenShift. And in APPUiO, it found a partner that offered even more advantages: ‘Experienced experts who work with OpenShift every day set up the platform for us in-house and trained us to use it,’ says Summer. Together with his team of five system engineers, Summer operates around 500 adcubum SYRIUS test installations. ‘Thanks to APPUiO, we can now deploy test environments at the touch of a button,’ he says.

Adcubum aims to transfer 95% of its development and test instances to OpenShift by the end of 2018. The challenge here is to prepare a 20-year-old application with several million lines of code for the new container platform. Although this requires significant effort, Summer expects the results to be wholly positive: ‘As we will be working on a single platform in future, collaboration between development and operations will improve greatly, and we’ll also become more efficient.’ Customers such as Helsana, Concordia, Visana and SUVA will also benefit. In future (from 2019 at the earliest), they will be able to access adcubum SYRIUS in container form and run it on their own OpenShift installations. ‘Customers will then be using the same development platform as us, which means that updates can be carried out automatically and far more frequently,’ explains Summer.

adcubum SYRIUS has been running on the OpenShift container platform APPUiO since the end of 2017. ‘Now we want to get our customers excited about OpenShift as well.’ To do so, Adcubum is working in close collaboration with APPUiO.
