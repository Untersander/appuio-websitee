APPUiO Cloud is our Kubernetes “Namespace as a Service” PaaS based on Red Hat OpenShift. It gives you instant access to a shared, fully managed, ready to use Red Hat OpenShift cluster in just a few minutes. Focus on your application rather than on setting up or managing your cluster, and bring your ideas to production in a breeze. It is a particularly good option for various use cases: independent Cloud Native app developers, mobile app backends, education, or startups of any kind can now get instant access to a ready-to-use, secure OpenShift 4 cluster.

APPUiO Cloud also includes various added benefits available off-the-box:

* [K8up](https://k8up.io/) to trigger and schedule backups of your applications into external S3 buckets.
* [AppCat](https://appcat.ch) to quickly provision databases, message queues, and more, directly from the comfort of your YAML infrastructure.
* And a comprehensive [help system](https://docs.appuio.cloud/) to guide you in your discovery of your new platform.

Head now to [portal.appuio.cloud](https://portal.appuio.cloud), open an account, create an organization, invite your coworkers, and start deploying applications on a standards-based, secure, and convenient platform, today.
