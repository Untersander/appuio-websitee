![APPUiO as Kubernetes Distributor](appuio_kubernetes_distributor.png)APPUiO allows you to orchestrate and manage containers with Kubernetes. You define how many of your application instances should run in parallel and Kubernetes then takes care of scaling, load balancing and stability.

The concept of Kubernetes is described in the ebook „The state of the Kubernetes Ecosystem“. It serves as a primer for both newcomers, assessors and implementers who are looking to make the most of the ecosystem of products and services emerging around Kubernetes. 

We are proud to be mentioned with APPUiO among big international brands in this ebook. It motivates to go on working with Kubernetes and bring each day more services to the cloud.
