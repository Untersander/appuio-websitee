  homeDistributionsDescriptionOne: APPUiO offers two well-established Kubernetes distributions which optimally cover different requirements for a container orchestration platform. In addition to the well-known Kubernetes features, both distributions offer additional functions and tools, which have been enhanced by the integration and combination of cloud-native products. Through a careful evaluation, APPUiO will help you to decide which of the Kubernetes distributions is right for you.

  homeDistributionsOneTitle: OpenShift
  homeDistributionsOneDesc: The focus of Red Hat OpenShift is on a full-stack Kubernetes platform. The platform provides end-to-end enterprise support from the operating system to the container platform to middleware applications. The OpenShift ecosystem already includes many tools to that help you with software development.
  homeDistributionsTwoTitle: Rancher

For this purpose Rancher Labs has developed the Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE), a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution. Rancher provides a central web and API-based multi-cluster management platform.


  # Home: Technologies sections
